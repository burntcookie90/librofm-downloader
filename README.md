# Libro.fm Audiobook Downloader

Small tool for checking your [libro.fm](https://libro.fm) library and downloading new books.

The tool is set to recheck the library every day and download new books. Books will be skipped if the `Author Name/Book Name` folder already exists.

## Extra Features

### Rename Chapters
Enable `RENAME_CHAPTERS` to rename files from `Track - #.mp3` to `### <Book Title> - <Chapter Title>` as provided by libro.fm
Additionally, if you enable `WRITE_TITLE_TAG`, each track's ID3 `title` field will be set to `### <Chapter Title>` as provided by libro.fm.

### M4B Transcode
Pass `M4B` as the `FORMAT` environment variable to have the service transcode and package the downloaded MP3 files to a single M4B file.

Use `AUDIO_QUALITY` with an `ffmpeg` valid quality to control the transcode quality. Default is `128k`

### API Server
After the initial download of your library, the container will run a API server.
Bind a host port to `8080` to access the services.

Endpoints:
- `/update` allows you to manually force a refresh (ie: when you just purchased a book).
